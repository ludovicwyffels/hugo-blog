Hi, I am Ludovic. üëã

In my 8 years of experience as a software developer, I worked for a startup for 2 years, as a mobile developer. I had the chance to experience what an MVP is and then rewrite it using the best practices of the market while having to evolve it.
We worked with the University of Antwerp on a predictive location algorithm for smartphones, in order to reduce their battery consumption, while keeping the accuracy of the location.

Then I joined IBM, where I was involved in several different projects. They gave me the chance to show what I could do and help me to become proficient in new technologies such as Kubernetes.
My skills range from design to production deployment.
The technologies I use are the following:
* Node.js
* Angular
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL

My vision for this blog is to be a source of knowledge for several software development topics revolving around JavaScript, Node.js, Typescipt, Cloud computing, continuous integration and continuous delivery.
